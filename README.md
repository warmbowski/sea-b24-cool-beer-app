<h1>Modular JS</h1>
<h3>CommonJS Modules, Clean Code, and Create Your Has-Many app</h3>

<!-- <img src=''/> -->

Assignment for CF B24:

Create an app that demonstrates you know how to use modules AND includes a has-many relationship.

For example, write a command line script or (small) express app that has two related resources like classes and students.

In a has-many relationship, a student could have many classes, or a class could have many students. Your app should print out or visualize that relationship.

The app should also use clean, modular code. Use module.exports. Follow the separation of concerns principle. Have each resource in a separate file. Use JSHint and JSCS to check your code style.

Submit a PR to your own repo.
